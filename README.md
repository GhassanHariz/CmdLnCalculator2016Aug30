# CmdLnCalculator2016Aug30

This is a basic object oriented (OOP) command line calculator written in C#.  It was developed using Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.

The calculator accepts on or more of these four operators: mulitplication, division, addition and subtraction (* / + -).  And it accepts integers only (not floats with decimal points).  The integers can be negative numbers (e.g. -4).

The calculator performs the multiply and divide operations first (in order from left to right).  Then it does addition and subtraction operations (in order from left to right).
